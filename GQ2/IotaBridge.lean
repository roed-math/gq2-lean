# P-16d6e4a, sub-lemma (C): the `ι_Γ ↔ inv_{ℚ₂}` obstruction bridge

The master-count / keystone layer measures the base-class obstruction with the **abstract**
coboundary indicator `iotaB` (`GQ2/PhaseObstruction.lean`); the §6 base-determinant layer
measures it with the **Tate invariant map** `iotaF ∘ H²ofFun` (`GQ2/SectionSix.lean`,
`Q0loc`).  On continuous 2-cocycles over `G_ℚ₂` the two agree, because `#H²(G_ℚ₂,𝔽₂) = 2` and
`iotaF D` is the invariant-map isomorphism.  This is the bridge that lets `prop_6_18`'s
`Q0loc`-Gauss-sum feed the `QZero` source-Gauss residue (P-16d6e4a; design
`docs/p16d6e4a-evaluation-design.md` §1(C)).

`iotaB_eq_iotaF_of_injective` is stated with the injectivity of `iotaF D` as an explicit
hypothesis — a self-contained, reusable form.  The injectivity itself (`iotaF D = D.inv ∘
mapCoeff2 muTwoOfF2`, both factors injective) is the enumerated remaining sub-obligation
`mapCoeff2_injective` (the degree-2 analog of `DeepPart.mapCoeff1_injective`).

/-- **The abstract↔invariant obstruction bridge** (P-16d6e4a §1(C)): on a continuous
2-cocycle `φ` over `G_ℚ₂`, the abstract coboundary indicator `iotaB φ` equals the Tate
invariant `iotaF D (H²ofFun φ)`, given `iotaF D` injective.  Both vanish exactly on `B²`, and
a `ZMod 2` value is determined by whether it is `0`. -/

/-! ## The injectivity of `iotaF` — `mapCoeff2` of a coefficient bijection

`iotaF D = D.inv ∘ mapCoeff2 muTwoOfF2`; `D.inv` is an `AddEquiv` and `muTwoOfF2` is the
`𝔽₂ ≅ μ₂` coefficient bijection, so the missing piece is the degree-2 analog of
`DeepPart.mapCoeff1_injective` — coboundaries pull back along the (automatically continuous,
discrete-coefficient) inverse.  Homed here rather than `Cohomology.lean` to avoid a
foundational-file rebuild; generic over `AbsGalQ2`-coefficient bijections. -/

/-- **`mapCoeff2` of an equivariant additive bijection is injective** (the degree-2
`DeepPart.mapCoeff1_injective`): a `B²`-witness on the target pulls back along the inverse,
which is continuous because the coefficients are discrete. -/
