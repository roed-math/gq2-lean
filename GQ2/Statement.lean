# The main theorem (Theorem 1.2)

We give the **surjection-count form** of the theorem, which is:
* complete and faithful to the paper (it is exactly paper eq. (154) combined with Prop. 2.3),
* statable with *current* Mathlib (no free profinite groups or `ℤ̂` needed), and
* equivalent to the literal presentation statement via Lemma 2.5 (`GQ2.reconstruction`).

Let `G_{ℚ₂}` be the absolute Galois group of `ℚ₂` (Mathlib's `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup ℚ_[2]`,
which for the char-0 field `ℚ₂` is the genuine `Gal(ℚ₂^sep/ℚ₂)`).

> **Theorem 1.2 (surjection-count form).** For every finite group `G`, the number of
> continuous surjections `G_{ℚ₂} ↠ G` equals the number of *admissible marked generating
> quadruples* in `G` (`GQ2.admissibleCount G`).

Combined with `GQ2.reconstruction` (Lemma 2.5) and `GQ2.admissibleCount = |Sur(Γ_A, ·)|`
(Prop. 2.3), this yields the literal statement `G_{ℚ₂} ≅ Γ_A`, i.e. Theorem 1.2 as printed.

## The literal presentation form (Theorem 1.2 as printed)

To state `G_{ℚ₂} ≅ ⟨σ,τ,x₀,x₁ | τ^σ=τ², h₀u₁⁻¹x₁^σc₀=1, ⟨⟨x₀,x₁⟩⟩ pro-2⟩` literally, one needs
two foundations **absent from Mathlib and its open PR queue** (see `docs/foundations-audit.md`):

1. `FreeProfiniteGroup (Fin 4)` and profinite presentations (quotient by the closed normal
   closure of the two relators), to build the candidate profinite group `Γ_A`.
2. `ℤ̂` and its idempotent `ω₂`, to interpret `x ^ ω₂` in the profinite group directly
   (on finite quotients this is `GQ2.powOmega2`, which we already have).

Given those, the candidate `Γ_A` satisfies (paper Prop. 2.3)
`Nat.card (ContSurj Γ_A G) = admissibleCount G` for every finite `G`, so
`main_surjection_count` becomes `∀ G, |Sur(Γ_A, G)| = |Sur(G_{ℚ₂}, G)|`, and `reconstruction`
(Lemma 2.5) delivers `Nonempty (ContinuousMulEquiv Γ_A G_{ℚ₂})` — Theorem 1.2.

This wiring is recorded as a `sorry`-backed target so the top-level logic is explicit:
-/

/-- **Theorem 1.2 (literal presentation form), schematic.** The candidate profinite group `Γ_A`
(hypothesised here with the property proved in Prop. 2.3, since `FreeProfiniteGroup`/`ℤ̂` are not
yet in Mathlib) is continuously isomorphic to `G_{ℚ₂}`.

`ΓA` stands in for the presented profinite group; `hΓA` is Prop. 2.3 (its finite quotients are the
admissible markings); `hfgΓ`/`hfgG` are topological finite generation of `Γ_A` and of `G_{ℚ₂}`
(both true — `G_{ℚ₂}` is topologically finitely generated, being the absolute Galois group of a
local field; assumed here as it is not yet formalized). The conclusion is Theorem 1.2. -/
