# B4: the rank-3 dyadic Demushkin presentation `D₀ = ⟨A, S, Y | A²S⁴[S,Y]⟩`  (ticket T-08)

The paper's Prop. 1.1 / Lemma 3.4 normalizes the maximal pro-2 quotient `G_{ℚ₂}(2)` as the
**Demushkin group** `D₀ = ⟨A, S, Y | A²S⁴[S,Y] = 1⟩` (Labute's classification at `d = 1`).  This file
constructs `D₀` as a `GQ2.profinitePresentation` and provides the relator; the actual isomorphism
`G_{ℚ₂}(2) ≅ D₀` is axiom **B4** in `GQ2/Foundations/Axioms.lean`.

* `GQ2.d0Relator : FreeProfiniteGroup (Fin 3)` — the relator `A²S⁴[S,Y]` with `A = of 0`, `S = of 1`,
  `Y = of 2`, commutator `[S,Y] = S⁻¹Y⁻¹SY` (the paper's `commP`, `GQ2/Words.lean`).  It is
  `ω₂`-free, hence a bare word in the free profinite group on three generators.
* `GQ2.D0 : ProfiniteGrp` — the presented group `profinitePresentation {d0Relator}`.

Stress test (`homEquiv` + a `decide`-able finite 2-group): the concrete marking
`A ↦ (reflection), S ↦ (order-4 rotation), Y ↦ (rotation²)` of `DihedralGroup 4` classifies a
continuous hom `F₃ ⟶ DihedralGroup 4` sending the generators as specified (`homD4_toMonoidHom_of`)
and killing the relator (`homD4_d0Relator`, by `decide`) — so the relation is satisfiable in a
genuine finite 2-group, and (`d0Relator_quotientMk_eq_one`) it holds in `D₀`.

/-! ## The relator and the presented group -/

/-- The **dyadic Demushkin relator** `r₀ = A²S⁴[S,Y]` (Labute [2], Thm 8 at `d = 1`; the paper's
`D₀` relation), as a word in the free profinite group on `Fin 3` with `A = of 0`, `S = of 1`,
`Y = of 2`.  Commutator convention: `[S,Y] = S⁻¹Y⁻¹SY` (`GQ2.commP`, matching `GQ2/Words.lean`). -/
noncomputable def d0Relator : FreeProfiniteGroup (Fin 3) :=
  FreeProfiniteGroup.of 0 ^ 2 * FreeProfiniteGroup.of 1 ^ 4 *
    commP (FreeProfiniteGroup.of 1) (FreeProfiniteGroup.of 2)

/-- The full profinite presentation `⟨A, S, Y | A²S⁴[S,Y]⟩` (before taking the pro-2 quotient).
The paper's `D₀ = G_{ℚ₂}(2)` is **pro-2**, so `D₀` is the maximal pro-2 quotient of this
(`D0` below); the bare presentation is *not* pro-2 — e.g. `A,S ↦ 0, Y ↦ 1` gives a surjection
onto `ℤ/3` (the relator dies in an abelian target), so its abelianization carries an odd part.
Working with the pro-2 quotient is what makes `topAbelianization D₀ ≅ ℤ/2 × ℤ₂ × ℤ₂` (paper (11))
and keeps axiom **B4** (`G_{ℚ₂}(2) ≅ D₀`, a pro-2 ≅ pro-2 statement) faithful. -/

/-- **`D₀`** (paper Prop. 1.1): the **pro-2** group presented by `⟨A, S, Y | A²S⁴[S,Y] = 1⟩`, i.e.
the maximal pro-2 quotient of the free profinite presentation.  This is the rank-3 dyadic
Demushkin group; axiom **B4** asserts `G_{ℚ₂}(2) ≅ D₀`. -/

/-- **The Demushkin relation on the named generators**: `A²S⁴[S,Y] = 1` in `D₀`.  It holds already
in the full presentation `D0Full` (`d0Full_relation`) and is pushed through the pro-2 quotient
homomorphism `maxProPMk` (which commutes with `*`, `^`, `commP` definitionally). -/

/-! ## Stress test: a concrete finite 2-group marking (`homEquiv` + `decide`)

`DihedralGroup 4` is a non-abelian group of order `8 = 2³`.  The marking `A ↦ sr 0` (a reflection,
order 2), `S ↦ r 1` (a rotation of order 4), `Y ↦ r 2` satisfies `A² = S⁴ = 1` and `[S,Y] = 1`
(rotations commute), so the relator dies — witnessing that `A²S⁴[S,Y] = 1` is realizable in a
genuine finite 2-group. -/

section StressTest

-- Explicit names: Lean's auto-namer does not encode the numeral, so an anonymous
-- `DihedralGroup 4` instance would clash with `DihedralGroup 3` instances elsewhere (e.g. `Zhat`)
-- once both are imported into `Foundations/Axioms.lean`.
