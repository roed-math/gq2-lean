# Appendix A/B: computational cross-checks of the `ω₂`-marking

The paper's Appendices A–B are an explicit, finite computational verification that is *independent*
of the proof (Remark 1.3): the auxiliary words and the relator are evaluated in finite groups, with
the profinite idempotent `ω₂ ∈ ℤ̂` replaced by an ordinary integer representative modulo the group's
exponent (App. B: `ω₂ ≡ 40491355905 (mod 85667662080)`).

This file makes that finite calculus rigorous and machine-checkable:

* `powOmega2_eq_one_of_odd`, `powOmega2_eq_self_of_orderOf_two_pow` — how `ω₂` acts elementwise
  (`≡ 0` on the odd part, `≡ 1` on the `2`-part); the App. A word-ledger building blocks.
* `markOmega2` — the App. B *computable* `ω₂`-power `x ↦ x ^ 40491355905`, proved equal to
  `powOmega2` on any group whose element orders divide `85667662080`.
* concrete admissible markings verified by `decide` (see `AppendixB` examples below).

`ω₂` replaced by its Appendix-B integer serialization `40491355905` (valid whenever the exponent
divides `M = 85667662080`).  Unlike `powOmega2` (which is noncomputable via `orderOf`), this is a
plain group power and so evaluates by `decide`/`#eval`. -/

Appendix-B modulus `M = 85667662080` (in particular on any group of exponent dividing `M`).  This is
`powOmega2_pow_eq` together with the verified `omega2Exp 85667662080 = 40491355905`. -/
