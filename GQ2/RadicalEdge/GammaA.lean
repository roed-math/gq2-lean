# Lemma 8.6, `Γ_A` source: the duality half via `prop_5_15`

The `Γ_A`-side analogue of `RadicalEdgeLocal.exists_good_twist`: from `NoDescent`, the
Fox–Heisenberg self-duality `prop_5_15` produces a nonzero *traced mixed pairing*
`mixedB t_ρ x_w y_φ ≠ 0`, where `y_φ` is the shifted-edge dual class and `x_w` its
`prop_5_15`-pairing partner.  This is the c3 result; the Θ–mixedB comparison
(`mixedB ≠ 0 ⟹ [varCoc u_w] ≠ 0`, using c2's `θ`) is the Γ_A half-torsor proof.

**Structural pivot (docs/orchestration/p16c3-recon.md):** `MuDual`'s `DistribMulAction` is hardcoded to
`AbsGalQ2` (`GQ2/TateDuality.lean`), so the local proof's `φf : Γ → MuDual 2 (Additive ↥T)`
does not port to `Γ = GA`.  The shifted-edge cocycle is built directly in
`ElemDual (Additive ↥T)` (generic `DistribMulAction C (ElemDual A)`, `FoxHeisenberg`;
`(g•λ)a = λ(g⁻¹•a)`), which also removes `dualAddEquiv` from the bridge.

Source group is the **raw** `GA = F₄ ⧸ N_A` (matching `WordCohBridge`; the `GammaA` transport
is the Γ_A half-torsor proof).  The `C = Bg ⧸ D.M`-conjugation action on `T` is the primary module structure
(what `mixedB`/`Z1w`/`markC` consume); the `GA`-action is its pullback `DistribMulAction.compHom
ρ` (so `hcompat` for `h1Equiv` is `rfl`).

Axioms (target): std-3 only — the pairing comes from `prop_5_15` (the Prop. 5.15 proof), not B6.
