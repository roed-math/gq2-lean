# Literature axioms for Theorem 1.2 — reviewer's enumeration

**Purpose.** This document reduces the formalization of the paper *A Profinite Presentation of the
Absolute Galois Group of `ℚ₂`* (D. C. Turturean, 2026) to a **minimal list of classical results that
already exist in the literature**, and enumerates them with precise statements and citations. It is
meant for a quick expert check: *does each "leaf" below correctly match a known
theorem in the cited reference?*

> **Update (T-20):** all ten leaves are now *stated in Lean* — see
> [`review-packet.md`](review-packet.md) for the Lean axiom name per leaf, the consolidated
> deviations table, and mechanical verification instructions.  The citations and per-result
> discussion below remain the authoritative literature reference.

**Scope of the reduction.** The paper's *own* §§3–9 argument (its Propositions and Lemmas) is
**granted** here — those are the paper's contribution, not literature, and are listed separately in
§C so you can also check they match the *paper*. What we isolate in §B are the **classical
foundations** the paper builds on. If every item in §B is a correct citation and every node in §C is
faithful to the paper, then (modulo the routine profinite assembly noted in §A) Theorem 1.2 follows.

**Lean status legend.**
- ✅ **faithful** — stated as a typechecked Lean `axiom`/`theorem` against current Mathlib, in
  `GQ2/Foundations.lean` (or already *proved*, in which case it is not a leaf at all).
- 🟡 **schematic** — the mathematical statement is precise (below) but a faithful Lean signature needs
  infrastructure Mathlib lacks (continuous Galois cohomology of a profinite group, Demushkin groups,
  local Tate duality pairings, the Hilbert symbol), so it is documented here, not in Lean.

## A. Top-level spine (how Theorem 1.2 is assembled)

```
Theorem 1.2   G_ℚ₂ ≅ ⟨σ,τ,x₀,x₁ | τ^σ=τ², h₀u₁⁻¹x₁^σc₀=1, ⟨⟨x₀,x₁⟩⟩ pro-2⟩
  │
  ├─ Lemma 2.5  (one-sided profinite reconstruction)          [Lean: reconstruction / reconstruction_of_equinum]

  │

        ├─ Prop 2.3   |Sur(Γ_A,G)| = admissibleCount G         [Lean: admissibleCount; hypothesised in main_presentation]
        ├─ Lemma 10.1 exhaustion by tame frames                [paper node — §C]
        └─ Theorem 4.2 boundary-framed exact-image (§9)        [paper node — §C]  ← the classical leaves in §B feed here
```

**On Lemma 2.5.** The paper states it with `Q` *any* profinite group and `|Sur(P,H)| = |Sur(Q,H)|`
as genuine cardinalities. The faithful Lean encoding is `GQ2.reconstruction_of_equinum`
(hypothesis `∀ H, Nonempty (ContSurj P H ≃ ContSurj Q H)`, i.e. equinumerosity — which for
finitely generated `P` forces the counts finite, matching the paper). `GQ2.reconstruction` is a
convenience specialization assuming *both* `P,Q` topologically f.g. with equal `Nat.card`. Its one
literature input — *a finitely generated profinite group is Hopfian* (RZ [4, §2.5], i.e.
Ribes–Zalesskiĭ *Profinite Groups* Prop. 2.5.2) — is **proved in this repo** as
`GQ2.profinite_hopfian`, so Lemma 2.5 has **no** remaining literature leaf; only the standard
profinite assembly `exists_contSurj_of_card_le` (below) is deferred, and it is Mathlib-provable, not
a literature gap.

**On `exists_contSurj_of_card_le` (not a literature leaf).** "A profinite group `R` is the inverse
limit of its finite quotients, so compatible surjections onto every finite quotient of `R` assemble
into a surjection onto `R`." This is standard (RZ Ch. 1–2) **and already available in Mathlib**:
`ProfiniteGrp.isoLimittoFiniteQuotientFunctor` (`R ≅ lim R/V`) plus
`nonempty_sections_of_finite_cofiltered_system` (König over `OpenNormalSubgroup R`, a
`SemilatticeInf`). Its arithmetic core is proved (`contSurj_quotient_nonempty_finite`); the remaining
categorical wiring is deferred work, **not** an axiom.

## B. The classical foundations (the minimal literature list)

Each is a published theorem. "Used at" points to the paper node in §C that consumes it.
**Citation-confidence markers** (see §E for the status summary):
`[✓ verified in the provided source]` checked directly against the PDF in `references/` (exact
theorem number and statement); `[quoted]` the paper itself cites this exact result; `[confirmed]`
checked against a reliable secondary source; `[likely]` my identification of a standard result, source
not yet to hand.

### B1. `G_ℚ₂` is topologically finitely generated  ✅ faithful
- **Statement.** The absolute Galois group of a `p`-adic local field `K` is topologically finitely
  generated (by `[K:ℚ_p]+3` generators when `μ_p ⊆ K`; `[K:ℚ_p]+2` otherwise).
- **Citation.** **NSW [1], Ch. VII §7.5, Theorem (7.5.14) (Jannsen–Wingberg)** `[✓ verified in the
  provided NSW]` — verbatim: `G_k` is generated by `N+3` generators `σ, τ, x₀,…,x_N`
  (`N = [k:ℚ_p]`) with the pro-`p` normal-closure condition, the tame relation `στσ⁻¹ = τ^q`, and one
  wild relation; in particular `G_k` is topologically finitely generated. Finite generation of the
  pro-`p` part is also **(7.5.11)** (Demushkin/free pro-`p`). Original: **Jannsen–Wingberg, Invent.
  Math. 70 (1982/83), 71–98**; Jannsen, Invent. Math. 70 (1982), 53–69. (The explicit `p=2` relation
  is *not* given by (7.5.14), which is the odd-`p` normal form — that gap is the Turturean paper.)
- **Lean.** `GQ2.Foundations.absGalQ2_isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`.
- **Used at.** `main_presentation` (`hfgG`), feeding Lemma 2.5.

### B2. 2-adic cyclotomic character is surjective  ✅ faithful · available/unused
- **Statement.** `χ_cyc : Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ) → ℤ₂ˣ` is surjective; equivalently `Gal(ℚ(μ_{2^∞})/ℚ) ≅ ℤ₂ˣ`.
- **Citation.** **Washington, *Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields*, 2nd ed., GTM 83, Ch. 2,
  Theorem 2.5** `[✓ verified in the provided source]` — verbatim: `deg(ℚ(ζ_n)/ℚ) = φ(n)` and
  `Gal(ℚ(ζ_n)/ℚ) ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)ˣ`, with `a` corresponding to `ζ_n ↦ ζ_n^a` (the cyclotomic character).
  Taking `n = 2^k` and the inverse limit gives `Gal(ℚ(μ_{2^∞})/ℚ) ≅ ℤ₂ˣ`, whence surjectivity.
- **Lean.** `GQ2.Foundations.cyclotomicCharacter_two_surjective` (via Mathlib `cyclotomicCharacter 2`).
- **Used at.** Underlies Lemma 3.6, but **no current Lean declaration consumes it** (adversarial
  review 2026-07-04, §4): Lemma 3.6 enters through **B8** (`peripheralCyclotomicAction`), which
  bundles its own cyclotomic-surjectivity need; B2 is retained as B8's citation companion and the
  global route to eliminate that dependency.

### B3. Classification of Demushkin groups (Labute)  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** A Demushkin pro-`p` group (finitely generated one-relator pro-`p` group with
  `dim H²(G,𝔽_p) = 1` and non-degenerate cup product `H¹×H¹→H²`) is determined up to isomorphism by
  its rank `n = dim H¹` and its invariant `q` (with a secondary invariant in the exceptional dyadic
  case). For the rank-3, `q=2` dyadic normal form the relator can be taken as `A²S⁴[S,Y]`, and the
  canonical orientation character is computed explicitly.
- **Citation.** **Labute [2], Theorem 8** (§5, "the group of the maximal `p`-extension of a local
  field") `[✓ verified in the provided source]`: for `q=2` and `d=[K:ℚ_p]` odd, `G_K(2)` is defined
  by `d+2` generators `x₁,…,x_{d+2}` with the single relation `x₁²x₂⁴[x₂,x₃][x₄,x₅]⋯=1`. For `K=ℚ₂`
  (`d=1`, odd) this is `⟨x₁,x₂,x₃ | x₁²x₂⁴[x₂,x₃]=1⟩` — **exactly the paper's `D₀=⟨A,S,Y|A²S⁴[S,Y]=1⟩`**.
  **Theorem 4, case (2)** (`q=2`, `n` odd) `[✓ verified]`: the canonical character `χ(x₁)=−1`,
  `χ(x₃)=(1−2^f)^{-1}`, `χ(x_i)=1` otherwise — the paper's `−1, 1, (1−2^f)^{-1}`. Labute attributes
  Theorem 8 to Serre [3]. (Canad. J. Math. 19 (1967), 106–132.)
- **Lean.** Schematic (Mathlib has no `Demushkin` predicate; a faithful statement needs pro-`p`
  cohomology with cup products).
- **Axiom form (B3c), a composite interface** (adversarial review 2026-07-04, §3): the axiomatized
  *orientation* half `GQ2.dyadicOrientation` is **not** a bare Labute citation — it bundles Labute's
  Thm 4(2) values *plus* the local-Galois fact (the Demushkin dualizing character equals the
  cyclotomic character, through *this* quotient map) *plus* the choice of a normalized B4
  isomorphism, and therefore **subsumes a marked B4**.  See its docstring and the classification
  table (`docs/review-packet.md` §2).
- **Used at.** Lemma 3.4 → Prop 1.1.

### B4. `G_ℚ₂(2)` is the rank-3 dyadic Demushkin group  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** The maximal pro-2 quotient `G_ℚ₂(2)` of the absolute Galois group is a Demushkin
  group of rank `[ℚ₂:ℚ₂]+2 = 3` with `q = 2`; concretely `G_ℚ₂(2) ≅ ⟨A,S,Y | A²S⁴[S,Y]=1⟩_{pro-2}`.
- **Citation.** **NSW [1], Ch. VII §7.5, Theorem (7.5.11)(ii)** `[✓ verified in the provided NSW]` —
  verbatim: if `μ_p ⊆ k` then `G_k(p)` is a Poincaré group of dimension 2 (i.e. a Demushkin group)
  of rank `N+2` (`N=[k:ℚ_p]`), with dualizing module the group of `p`-power roots of unity in `k(p)`.
  For `k=ℚ₂`: `p=2`, `N=1`, `μ_2={±1}⊆ℚ₂`, so **rank `1+2 = 3`** ✓. The explicit relation is
  **Labute [2], Theorem 8** at `d=1`: `⟨A,S,Y | A²S⁴[S,Y]=1⟩` `[✓ verified]` (= the paper's `D₀`).
  Also **Serre [3]**, Sém. Bourbaki 252 (1962/63); **Demushkin**.
- **Lean.** Schematic (needs the maximal pro-2 quotient of `G_ℚ₂` as an object; the *relator*
  `A²S⁴[S,Y]` itself is expressible in `FreeProfiniteGroup (Fin 3)` — it uses no `ω₂`).
- **Used at.** Lemma 3.4 → Prop 1.1.

### B5. Local reciprocity (local class field theory for `ℚ₂`)  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** The local Artin/reciprocity map `rec : ℚ₂ˣ → G_ℚ₂^{ab}` is an injective homomorphism
  with dense image, normalized so that a uniformizer maps to (arithmetic) Frobenius, inducing
  `ℚ₂ˣ / N_{L/ℚ₂}(Lˣ) ≅ Gal(L/ℚ₂)` for finite abelian `L/ℚ₂`; on the cyclotomic quotient it recovers
  `χ_cyc(rec(u)) = u⁻¹`.
- **Citation.** **NSW [1], Ch. VII §7.1: Theorem (7.1.1) (Class Field Axiom) and Corollary (7.1.5)**
  `[✓ verified in the provided NSW]` — (7.1.5): `(G_k, k̄ˣ)` is a class formation, whence the local
  reciprocity/norm-residue homomorphism `k ˣ → G_k^{ab}` (and (7.1.9) for the `p`-adic case).
  Secondary: **Serre, *Local Fields* [7], Part IV, Ch. XI–XII** (Class Formations / Local CFT)
  `[likely; corrects an earlier "Ch. VI" typo]`. Normalization (uniformizer ↦ arith. Frobenius):
  paper Lemma 3.5.
- **Lean.** Schematic (CFT provides abstract class-formation reciprocity `reciprocityIso`/`localInv`,
  but not the specific local Artin map `ℚ₂ˣ → G^{ab}`; `LocalCFT/` is early).
- **Used at.** Lemma 3.5 (marked abelianization, orientation, initial form).

### B6. Local Tate duality  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** For a `p`-adic local field `K` and a finite `G_K`-module `M` (with `M' = Hom(M,μ)`
  the Tate dual), the cup product `H^i(G_K,M) × H^{2-i}(G_K,M') → H²(G_K,μ) ≅ ℚ/ℤ` is a perfect
  pairing of finite groups, for `i = 0,1,2`.
- **Citation.** **NSW [1], Ch. VII §7.2, Theorem (7.2.6) "Tate Duality"** `[✓ verified in the
  provided NSW]` — verbatim: for a `p`-adic local field `k`, finite `G_k`-module `A`, `A₀=Hom(A,μ)`,
  the cup product `H^i(k,A₀) × H^{2-i}(k,A) → H^2(k,μ) ≅ ℚ/ℤ` induces isomorphisms of finite abelian
  groups `H^i(k,A₀) ≅ H^{2-i}(k,A)*` for `0 ≤ i ≤ 2`. Also **Serre, *Galois Cohomology*, Ch. II §5.2,
  Theorem 2** `[✓ verified in the provided source]` (same cup-product duality; "due to Tate"); Milne,
  *ADT*, Ch. I, Thm I.2.1. Original: Tate.
- **Lean.** Schematic (needs continuous Galois cohomology of the profinite `G_K` and the cup-product
  pairing; Mathlib/CFT have finite-group `H^i` via `Rep R G` but not the continuous duality package).
- **Used at.** §5 (the three-term duality complex, Lemmas 5.11/5.13) and §9.2.

### B7. Local Euler–Poincaré characteristic  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** For `K` `p`-adic and finite `G_K`-module `M`,
  `|H⁰(G_K,M)| · |H²(G_K,M)| / |H¹(G_K,M)| = ‖#M‖_K = (#M)^{-[K:ℚ_p]}` (the `p`-part). In particular
  for the elementary 2-modules `M` of §9.2 over `ℚ₂` this gives `H²=0` and `|Z¹(M)| = 2^{2·dim M}`.
- **Citation.** **NSW [1], Ch. VII §7.3, Theorem (7.3.1) (Tate)** `[✓ verified in the provided NSW]`
  — verbatim: for every finite `G_k`-module `A` of order `a` prime to `char(k)`, `χ(k,A) = ‖a‖_k`
  (the normalized absolute value); so `|H⁰||H²|/|H¹| = ‖a‖_k = a^{-[k:ℚ_p]}` (`p`-part). Also
  **Serre, *Galois Cohomology*, Ch. II §5.7, Theorem 5** `[✓ verified in the provided source]`
  (`χ(A)=‖a‖_k`, Tate; `χ` defined in §5.4; the `𝔽_p`-coefficient form `ϱ(A)=-N·dim A` is Exercise 2,
  p. 101 — exactly the `|Z¹|=2^{2·dim M}` input of §9.2); Milne, *ADT*, Ch. I, Thm I.2.8.
- **Lean.** Schematic (same continuous-cohomology gap as B6).
- **Used at.** §9.2 (lifting through the elementary quotient `M`; strict decrease (145)).

### B7′. Dyadic Hilbert symbol formula  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** For `ℚ₂` the Hilbert symbol `(·,·)₂ : ℚ₂ˣ/ℚ₂ˣ² × ℚ₂ˣ/ℚ₂ˣ² → {±1}` is given by
  `(2^α u, 2^β v)₂ = (-1)^{ε(u)ε(v) + α ω(v) + β ω(u)}`, where `ε(u) = (u-1)/2 mod 2`,
  `ω(u) = (u²-1)/8 mod 2`. In the square-class basis `(-1,2,-3)` this yields `(-1,-1)₂ = -1`,
  `(2,-3)₂ = -1`, others trivial — the cup-product initial form `α² + βγ + γβ`.
- **Citation.** **Serre, *A Course in Arithmetic*, GTM 7, Ch. III (Hilbert symbol) §1.2, Theorem 1**
  `[✓ verified in the provided source]` — verbatim, for `k=ℚ_p`, `a=p^α u`, `b=p^β v` (`u,v ∈ U`):
  `(a,b) = (-1)^{ε(u)ε(v) + αω(v) + βω(u)}` when `p=2`, where **`ε(u) ≡ (u-1)/2`, `ω(u) ≡ (u²-1)/8`
  (mod 2)** are defined in Ch. II §3.3 (p. 18) — exactly the paper's Lemma 3.5 formula.
- **Lean.** Schematic (Mathlib has no Hilbert symbol).
- **Used at.** Lemma 3.5 and §6 (base quadratic form, Arf invariant).

### B8. Galois action on `π₁(ℙ¹∖{0,1,∞})` and its peripheral structure  🟡 schematic · composite
- **Statement.** The outer Galois action `G_ℚ → Out(Δ)` on the geometric maximal pro-2 fundamental
  group `Δ = π₁^{pro-2}(ℙ¹_{ℚ̄}∖{0,1,∞})` sends the three peripheral inertia generators `P,T,C` to
  cyclotomic conjugates (`φ_u(P) = c_P^{-1} P^u c_P`, etc., for `u ∈ ℤ₂ˣ`).
- **Composite** (adversarial review 2026-07-04, §1): the Stix citation supports the *action through
  the cyclotomic character*; producing an automorphism for **every** `u ∈ ℤ₂ˣ` additionally needs
  cyclotomic surjectivity (B2 globally / B5's `χ_cyc∘rec = (·)⁻¹` locally).  The statement is kept
  in all-units form (P-22, user decision); weakening to the cyclotomic image was declined.
- **Citation.** **Stix [8], §3.3 ("Cusps and inertia subgroups") and Definition 37 ("local
  orientation at each cusp")** `[✓ verified in the provided source]` — exactly the paper's citation
  `[8, Section 3.3 and Definition 37]`: the decomposition group of a rational cusp acts on the
  procyclic inertia group through the cyclotomic character. (Full ref: J. Stix, *On cuspidal sections
  of algebraic fundamental groups*, in *Galois–Teichmüller Theory and Arithmetic Geometry*, ASPM 63
  (2012), 519–563.) The paper does **not** cite Deligne; the classical *origin* of the cyclotomic
  inertia action is Deligne, *Le groupe fondamental de la droite projective moins trois points*, in
  *Galois Groups over ℚ* (Ihara–Ribet–Serre, eds.), MSRI Publ. 16 (1989), §§8, 15–19.
- **Lean.** Schematic (no étale/anabelian `π₁` in Mathlib).
- **Used at.** Lemma 3.6.

### B9. Evens transfer / total Stiefel–Whitney class machinery  🟡 schematic
- **Statement.** The Evens multiplicative transfer and the Evens–Kahn formula for the total
  Stiefel–Whitney class of an induced/quadratic representation, used to normalize the half-orbit
  Evens class and compute the base Arf invariant over `𝔽₂[C]`.
- **Citation** (precise; verified against the provided PDFs):
  * **Evens norm** `N_{H→G} : H²(H,k) → H²(G,k)`, with `N(1+x) = 1 + tr_{H→G}(x) + N(x)` for index 2,
    and its double-coset (Mackey) restriction formula: **Evens [9], §§4–5, Theorem 1**
    `[✓ verified]` (Trans. AMS 108 (1963), 54–65).
  * **Total SW class of a transferred quadratic form**: **Kahn [10], Théorème 2**
    `w(T(q)) = N′(w(q))·w(T(1))^r` — with **Théorème 1** (induced reps `w(Ind ρ)=N′(w(ρ))w(Ind1)^r`)
    and **Théorème 3** `w(T⟨a⟩)=w(Ind ρ_a)(1+(2,d))`; topological version **Théorème 1.3.2**
    `[✓ verified]` (Invent. Math. 78 (1984), 223–256).
  * **Index-2 Evens–Kahn formula** (total SW class of an index-2 induced rep): **Kozlowski [11],
    Theorem 1.1** (index-2 special case) `[✓ verified]` (Proc. AMS 91 (1984), 309–313).
  The paper's eq. (111) `w(Tr_{L/k}⟨a⟩) = w(Tr_{L/k}⟨1⟩)(1 + cor_{L/k}[a] + N^{Ev}_{L/k}[a])` is
  Kahn Th. 2 at `q=⟨a⟩` (rank 1) expanded via Evens Th. 1. **Guillot [6]** is a *background* reference
  (in the bibliography only — no body citation).
- **Lean.** Schematic (no Stiefel–Whitney/Evens classes in Mathlib).
- **Used at.** §6 (Lemmas 6.13 (Evens norm normalization), 6.16 (deep-unit Evens norm)); the
  Shapiro–corestriction of Lemma 6.15 is Kahn Th. 2's Shapiro case.

**Already discharged (not leaves).**
- **Ribes–Zalesskiĭ Hopfian** (a finitely generated profinite group is Hopfian): **RZ [4],
  *Profinite Groups*, 2nd ed. (2010), Proposition 2.5.2** `[confirmed]` (the paper cites "[4, §2.5]").
  *Proved* in this repo as `GQ2.profinite_hopfian` (standard axioms).
- **Schur–Zassenhaus** (§9.1 terminal case) — in Mathlib (`Mathlib.GroupTheory.SchurZassenhaus`);
  used via `GQ2.FiniteGroup.oddOrder_twoQuotient_split`, already proved.

**Bottom line for review.** The whole theorem rests on **ten** classical inputs (B1–B10, B10 added post-kickoff by the P-06 census decision); of the two
finite-group inputs that would also have appeared (RZ Hopfian, Schur–Zassenhaus) both are already
proved. B1–B2 are machine-checked faithful statements; B3–B9 are precise here but await Mathlib
infrastructure (Demushkin groups, continuous Galois cohomology + Tate duality, Hilbert symbols,
Stiefel–Whitney/Evens classes, étale `π₁`) before they can be stated faithfully in Lean.

## E. Verification status (against the PDFs in `references/`)

**✅ Verified against the provided sources (exact theorem number + statement checked):**
- **B1** — NSW **(7.5.14)** (Jannsen–Wingberg: `N+3` generators, tame + one wild relation ⇒ `G_k`
  top. f.g.) and **(7.5.11)**.
- **B4** — NSW **(7.5.11)(ii)** (`μ_p⊆k ⇒ G_k(p)` Demushkin of rank `N+2`); for `ℚ₂`, rank `3`.
- **B5** — NSW **(7.1.1)** Class Field Axiom, **(7.1.5)** `(G_k,k̄ˣ)` is a class formation.
- **B6** — NSW **(7.2.6)** "Tate Duality" (exact cup-product pairing verified verbatim).
- **B7** — NSW **(7.3.1)** (Tate): `χ(k,A)=‖a‖_k` (verified verbatim).
- **B7′** — Serre, *Course in Arithmetic*, **Ch. III §1.2 Thm 1** — the `p=2` formula
  `(a,b)=(-1)^{ε(u)ε(v)+αω(v)+βω(u)}` and `ε,ω` (Ch. II §3.3) verified verbatim (= paper Lemma 3.5).
- **B6 / B7 secondary** — Serre, *Galois Cohomology*, **Ch. II §5.2 Theorem 2** (Tate duality) and
  **§5.7 Theorem 5** (`χ(A)=‖a‖_k`) verified verbatim (corroborate the NSW primaries).
- **B9** — **Evens [9] §§4–5 Thm 1** (norm map; `N(1+x)=1+tr(x)+N(x)`, index 2), **Kahn [10]
  Théorèmes 1–3** (SW class of induced/transferred forms), **Kozlowski [11] Theorem 1.1** (index-2
  Evens–Kahn formula) — the exact results behind the paper's eq. (111), all verified. **Guillot [6]**
  is bibliography-only (background); not a load-bearing citation.

**Also verified (later-added sources):**
- **B2** — Washington, *Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields*, **Ch. 2 Theorem 2.5**
  (`Gal(ℚ(ζ_n)/ℚ) ≅ (ℤ/n)ˣ` via the cyclotomic character) — verified verbatim.
- **B10** — NSW **(7.5.3) (Iwasawa)** — "the Galois group of the maximal tamely ramified
  extension of a local field is the profinite group generated by two elements σ, τ with the
  only relation στσ⁻¹ = τ^q" — verified verbatim, with **(7.5.2)** (the split extension).
  Convention note: NSW's arithmetic `σ` vs the paper's geometric `σ` (`τ^σ = τ²`) — the
  presentations agree under `σ ↦ σ⁻¹` (see `GQ2/TameQuotient.lean`).
- **B8** — Stix [8], **§3.3 + Definition 37** (the paper's exact citation): cyclotomic action on
  cuspidal inertia — verified. (Deligne, MSRI 16 (1989), is the classical *origin*, not cited by the
  paper.)
- **B3** — Labute [2], **Theorem 8** (`q=2`, `d` odd: `G_K(2)` has `d+2` generators, relation
  `x₁²x₂⁴[x₂,x₃]⋯`; at `d=1` = the paper's `D₀`) and **Theorem 4 case (2)** (canonical character
  `−1, (1−2^f)^{-1}, 1`) — both verified verbatim.

**🟡 Pending line-local PDF verification (deferred to P-20):**
- **B11a / B11b** — Serre, *Local Fields* [7], **Ch. XIV §2** (Hilbert-symbol norm criterion:
  `[a]∪[b]=0 ⟺ b` is a norm from `k(√a)`) and **Ch. V §2** (units of an unramified extension are
  norms).  The content is standard local class field theory, but the exact display/theorem numbers
  are **not yet** line-checked against the `references/` Serre PDF — these leaves were added by
  P-15/P-23 *after* this section's verification pass, so their citation numbers are resolved by
  **P-20**.  The repo-specific "unramified = equal spectral-norm value groups" bridge is a `def`
  (`GQ2.IsUnramifiedQuadraticSpectral`), a named convention rather than a cited theorem, so it adds
  no proof-theoretic strength (P-23).

**Discharged (proved in-repo):** RZ Hopfian = **Prop. 2.5.2** (also confirmed against source);
Schur–Zassenhaus (Mathlib).

**Tertiary corroboration still unchecked:** **Milne *ADT* I.2.1/I.2.8** (free online) — for B6/B7,
superfluous now that both NSW **and** Serre *GC* are verified.

**Net: eleven of the thirteen leaves (B1–B10, B7′) are source-verified** — each carries an exact
theorem number and a verbatim statement checked against the provided PDFs (B6/B7 doubly-sourced;
B3's Theorem 8 at `d=1` reproduces the paper's `D₀` on the nose). The two would-be finite-group
inputs (RZ Hopfian Prop. 2.5.2, Schur–Zassenhaus) are *proved* in the formalization. The remaining
two leaves — **B11a/B11b** (added by P-15/P-23) — carry standard local-CFT content but await a
line-local Serre *Local Fields* quote (deferred to **P-20**); nothing else in the classical layer
remains unchecked.
